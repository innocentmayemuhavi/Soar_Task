## Assumptions

- JSON files are used as API dummies to mock API endpoints for fetching user information,card details, charts data, and transaction history.
- These JSON files are located in the `public/backend` directory and are used to simulate the responses from a real backend server.
- The services in the `src/services` directory handle the fetching of data from these mock JSON files using Axios as middleware.
